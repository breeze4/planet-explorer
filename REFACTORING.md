okay now analyze the code in the project and propose refactoring based on possible future features like neutral and enemy spaceships flying around independently, trading markets on each planet, interactive planet resource gathering persistent mini game. Don't add the new features, but make refactoring recommendations based on those needs.

## Refactoring Recommendations

**1. Introduce an Entity Management System**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create an `EntityManager` class to handle all game entities (player, AI ships, planets).
    *   Update `Game` class to delegate entity management (updates, rendering) to `EntityManager`.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** The `Game` class directly manages arrays of `planets` and the single player `spaceship`.
    *   **Problem:** Adding potentially many neutral and enemy AI spaceships, each with its own state and behavior, will make the `Game` class overly complex and hard to manage.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated `EntityManager` class. This class would be responsible for holding *all* game entities (player ship, AI ships, planets, potentially asteroids, stations later). The `Game` class would interact with the `EntityManager` to update and render entities, rather than managing them directly.
    *   **Benefit:** Decouples the main game loop from the specifics of each entity type. Makes adding, removing, and querying entities (e.g., "find all ships near planet X") much cleaner and more scalable.

**2. Refactor Planet Interaction Logic**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Move planet landing/interaction code out of `Game.update` into `Planet` or a dedicated `InteractionSystem`.
    *   Add data fields to `Planet` for storing market details and resource availability.
    *   Replace the global `isPaused` flag with a more flexible game state management system (e.g., state machine).
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** Landing logic is handled within the `Game.update` method and pauses the entire game state (`this.isPaused = true`).
    *   **Problem:** Trading markets and resource gathering minigames suggest more complex interactions that might not require pausing the *entire* simulation (e.g., AI ships could continue flying). The current pausing mechanism is too coarse. Also, planet-specific data (market prices, resource availability) needs a place to live.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Move interaction logic (detecting landing possibility, handling the 'E' key press, showing planet views) potentially into the `Planet` class itself or a dedicated `InteractionSystem`.
        *   Introduce data structures within the `Planet` class (or dedicated components, see next point) to store market information and resource data.
        *   Re-evaluate the pausing mechanism. Consider a more granular state management system (e.g., using a state machine pattern) to handle different views like 'Space View', 'Planet View', 'Market View', 'Minigame View', allowing parts of the simulation to continue running if needed.
    *   **Benefit:** Organizes planet-specific logic and data. Allows for richer, potentially non-pausing interactions suitable for markets and minigames.

**3. Develop an AI Framework**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Establish a basic AI system/framework (`AISystem` or AI methods in `Spaceship`) for non-player ship behavior.
    *   Implement core AI functionalities like pathfinding and decision-making logic.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** No system exists for autonomous agent behavior.
    *   **Problem:** Neutral and enemy ships need logic to navigate, make decisions (trade, patrol, attack), and interact with the environment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create dedicated structures for AI. This could be an `AISystem` that processes entities with an `AIComponent`, or perhaps add methods like `updateAI(deltaTime, worldState)` to the `Spaceship` class (or a derived `AISpaceship` class). This framework would handle pathfinding, decision-making, and behavior execution for non-player ships.
    *   **Benefit:** Encapsulates complex AI logic, keeping it separate from player controls and the main game loop.

**4. Consider a Component-Based Architecture (Advanced)**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Decompose `Spaceship` and `Planet` classes into smaller, reusable `Components` (e.g., `Position`, `Physics`, `Inventory`).
    *   Create dedicated `Systems` (e.g., `MovementSystem`, `RenderSystem`) that process entities based on their components.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** Classes like `Spaceship` and `Planet` likely encapsulate all their data and logic.
    *   **Problem:** As features like AI, trading inventories, resource nodes, etc., are added, these classes can become monolithic ("god objects") and difficult to manage or extend.
    *   **Recommendation:** Break down entity properties and behaviors into reusable `Components` (e.g., `Position`, `Renderable`, `Physics`, `AIBehavior`, `Inventory`, `Market`, `ResourceNode`). Entities would become simple containers of components. Dedicated `Systems` (e.g., `MovementSystem`, `RenderSystem`, `AISystem`, `TradingSystem`) would operate on entities possessing the relevant components.
    *   **Benefit:** Highly flexible, promotes code reuse, and makes adding new features often just a matter of creating new components and systems without modifying existing ones extensively. This is a larger architectural shift but very powerful for complex games.

**5. Implement an Event System (Optional but Good Practice)**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Introduce an event bus to facilitate decoupled communication between game modules.
    *   Refactor direct method calls (e.g., UI updates) to use emitted/handled events.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** Components likely call methods on each other directly (e.g., `Game` calls `spaceship.update()`, `ui.showMessage()`).
    *   **Problem:** Direct calls lead to tighter coupling, making components harder to test or reuse independently.
    *   **Recommendation:** Introduce a simple event bus or dispatcher. Objects can emit events (e.g., `PlayerLandedEvent`, `TradeCompletedEvent`, `ResourceGatheredEvent`) and other interested objects can subscribe to these events without needing direct references.
    *   **Benefit:** Decouples different parts of your game (e.g., the UI can react to an inventory change without the inventory system needing to know about the UI).

**6. Plan for Persistence**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Define how persistent data (player resources, market states) will be structured.
    *   Implement mechanisms for saving and loading game state, potentially using `localStorage`.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:** Game state seems largely transient.
    *   **Problem:** The resource gathering minigame is described as "persistent," implying player progress (gathered resources) should be saved. Market data might also need to persist or evolve dynamically.
    *   **Recommendation:** Design how persistent data will be structured and stored. This might involve adding properties to the player's `Spaceship` or a separate `PlayerData` object for resources, and potentially mechanisms within `Planet` or a `MarketSystem` for persistent market states. Implement saving/loading using `localStorage` or potentially a backend service if needed later.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables the persistent nature of the minigame and potentially saving the overall game state.
